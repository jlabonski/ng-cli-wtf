    "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
      As he landed his crew with care;
    Supporting each man on the top of the tide
      By a finger entwined in his hair.

    "Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
      That alone should encourage the crew.
    Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
      What I tell you three times is true."
