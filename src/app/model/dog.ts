    "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
      As he landed his crew with care;
    Supporting each man on the top of the tide
      By a finger entwined in his hair.

    "Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
      That alone should encourage the crew.
    Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
      What I tell you three times is true."

  }

  The crew was complete: it included a Boots—
    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods—
  A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—
    And a Broker, to value their goods.


  Please note that this really shouldn't compile.
